This project is a JavaScript project that shows the portfolio of a job seeker. 
The home page shows a username field and a password field.
There is also a 'Click Me' button that attracts attention by increasing and decreasing in size at irregular intervals.
A user should enter the username and password which are: username: username; password: password.
On clicking the 'Click Me' button, it stops changing size, then buttons appear at the bottom of the page as links to information about the applicant.
On approaching any of the buttons with the mouse, it increases in size.
If any of the buttons is clicked, it displays the information corresponding to it.
